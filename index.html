	Me and my school went to Archer-Malmok for a school field trip. We went onto an elevator which led us up to a working space on one of the floors. The workers their told us a lot about Archer-Malmo and there jobs. They told us each job has something they’re good at and theirs many jobs they do their perfect for each person. After they showed us a slide show we asked some questions and they answers.</p>
<p>
After the questions they offered to show us around the place. We went to many floors and working spaces. One of the floors had a bunch of rooms with meetings in it. We also went to a place where they shoot a lot of videos with green screens. They let us ask questions about the room and what they do in their. About how the room is sound proof from the outside. </p>
<p>
The workers of Archer-Malmo also showed us a slide show, which discussed what they did, what type of jobs each individual had. They were all listed in groups and they were very organized. They also showed us a lot of projects they have completed for big companies. They told us that they only work for big companies over 500 million and up, and only rarely work for the smaller one.</p>
<p>
I learned that Archer-Malmo has a very productive and friendly environment. It would be a great place too work if you know how to code. I learned that they also allowed dogs in Archer-Malmo and how they’re always busy working and planning. I have learned from my visit that they are very organized, do not slack around, and they always get there work done on time.</p>
<p>
After the visit to Archer-Malmo we went out to eat to a place called “Cook Out.” It is a very good place to go eat and gives your food fast. The lines were really long but the food tasted good. I got many meals there then afterwards we went to get back on the bus and returned to campus.</p>
